                Chef of the Month
                <br>
                <p>Courtney Barros is the owner and founder of Courtney Cakes in Morgan Hill, CA. Courtney is
                    self-taught and specializes in custom cakes and sugar cookies.

                    Courtney has been baking casually for decades, but in 2019, she started baking with the intention to
                    be more creative. She realized that the more we use creativity, the more creative we become. In
                    2020, she decided to make the leap from hobby baker to part-time business owner as a way to support
                    her creative projects. She loves that she has learned so much already from starting a business, and
                    looks forward to continuing to learn.

                    Using a sharp knife, remove stems from collard greens. Cut leaves into 2-inch squares (about 14
                    cups), and rinse in cold water.

                    Heat olive oil in a 4-quart stockpot over medium. Add bacon; cook until crisp, about 10 minutes.
                    Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain, reserving drippings in pot. Crumble bacon, and set aside.

                    Add onions and garlic to hot drippings in pot, and cook over mediumv, stirring often, until golden
                    brown, about 25 minutes. Add ham hocks, and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes,
                    turning ham hocks every 45 seconds. Add bourbon and vinegar, and cook, stirring and scraping up
                    browned bits on bottom of pot, until liquid is reduced by half, about 30 seconds. Add 8 cups cold
                    water; bring to a simmer.

                Secret Ingredient
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the temperatures drop, sometimes all you crave is a big bowl of beef stew, and this recipe most
                    definitely hits the spot. This savory, rich stew may be named after one secret ingredient, but it's
                    because of a complex mix of components that it succeeds so well. Tomatoes and tomato paste give it a
                    sunny sweetness, finely chopped veggies lend a lot texture, and red wine and vinegar brighten
                    everything up. Anchovies, the "secret ingredient," are briny and buttery, giving the sauce a smooth,
                    complex finish. The hit of umami really brings the flavor of this stew over the top. You may not use
                    anchovies regularly, but this stew will convince you otherwise. We also recommend using beef with
                    generous marbling for the best results.
